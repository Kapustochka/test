You are testing a checkout system for a restaurant. There is a new endpoint that will calculate the total of the order, and add a 10% service charge on food.

The restaurant only serves starters, mains and drinks, and the set cost for each is:

Starters cost £4.00, 
Mains cost £7.00, 
Drinks cost £2.50
Drinks have a 30% discount when ordered before 19:00

Write tests to cover the following Scenarios


Scenarios

1. 
A group of 4 people order 4 starters, 4 mains and 4 drinks. The endpoint returns a correctly calculated bill

2. 
A group of 2 people order 1 starter and 2 mains and 2 drinks before 19:00. The bill is requested and the correct amount is shown on the bill.
The group of two people are then joined by 2 more people at 20:00 who order 2 mains and 2 drinks, when the party is ready to leave the final bill is requested and is correct.

3. 
A group of 4 people order a starter, 1 mains and a drink each. The bill is requested and correctly calculated. A member of the group cancels their order and the order is now updated to reflect one member of the party leaving.  A final bill is requested as the party is ready to leave and final amount is correct and reflects the changes to the group.


Please create a class/method that represents the above requirements and write the associated test cases with any test framework of your choice.
 
Once complete upload the project to your Gitub account and forward the Github url within the timeframe specified.
